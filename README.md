# One Moon

Planner for Anxious Folk

## Summary

One Moon is an app designed with people who experience tension and anxiety in mind. Try creating a
to-do list for just one month.

In today’s busy world, thinking too far ahead can often leave us feeling overwhelmed and unsettled.
That’s why it’s essential to focus on what we can do right now, taking steady steps forward rather
than worrying about the distant future.

One Moon helps you concentrate on this month alone, guiding you toward a clearer sense of direction
in the immediate future. Set simple goals, work through them step-by-step, and gradually ease the
feeling of being overwhelmed. Take a step back from the complexity of life and work toward achieving
your tasks for today, this week, and this month.

At the end of each month, all to-do items will disappear. Use this to-do list as a way to embrace
each day, week, and month as a fresh start.
